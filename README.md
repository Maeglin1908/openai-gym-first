# Keras Gym test Project

This project is my first test using Tensorflow, keras, and pygame.

The thing is simple :  
A virtual shower is initialized with a random temperature (-40 - 120), then the AI will predict action to make the shower temp. between 37-39.

I trained the AI on 60k steps, then on 100k steps, which give me better result.

To run it, once on the repo directory : 
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

That run as a loop, to make it infinite.
